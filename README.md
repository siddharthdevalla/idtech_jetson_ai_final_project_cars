My Final Ai Project is determining the car model by looking at the logo shown through the AI camera. 
The car models being tested include : Honda, Tesla, and Audi. 
The first step would be to set up the camera. 
After setting up the camera, the variables must be made for each one of the cars. Since there are three cars being tested, three variables must be made.  
A data collection tool will be made after the categories of the variables is established.
After the collection widget, a neural network will be defined to give the needed results for the project. 
Lastly, after that the interactive tool will need to be ran so that the training of the photos can begin.
